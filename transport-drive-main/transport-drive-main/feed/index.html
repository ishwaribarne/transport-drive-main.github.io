				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Graham got his first taste of commercial driving while working for a Chicago-based utilities company. But jumping from Chicago suburb to Chicago suburb wasn’t quite the adventure he was hoping for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-937.jpg" width="510" height="287" alt="dti truck driver" class="wp-image-35457 alignright size-full" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-937.jpg 510w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-937-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" />A 15-year veteran of the Armed Services, Harry Graham sought a career with a military-friendly company that would let him see the world and grant him the flexibility to remain a member of the Reserves. He also needed to feel a sense of camaraderie with his fellow team members, just as he had throughout his years of military service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, he found exactly what he needed in Dot Transportation thanks to a tip from his nephew, a fellow first-year DTI driver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He gave me a call and said DTI was hiring for truck drivers, so I put in an application, listed him as a referral, and now I’m here,” he said. “We’re both truck drivers now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still in one-on-one training, Harry is eager to hit the road solo in the coming weeks. But like any new driver, he expects some nerves to kick in in advance of the big day.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a trainer in the cab with you is kind of like a safe haven, but when the trainer’s gone and you cut loose on your own, all those safety measures are gone,” he said. “Initially I think I’ll be a little bit nervous, but I think I’ll be alright.”</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says he is looking forward to the chance to meet new people, see new sights, and provide for his family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-1086.jpg" width="510" height="287" alt="dti truck driver" class="wp-image-35458 alignleft size-full" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-1086.jpg 510w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-1086-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" />“I always liked the idea of being a truck driver. I’ve been wanting to do it for years,” he said. “DTI seems like it’s a big family, and that’s what I really like because the military is a big family. That’s what stood out for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still a proud member of the Reserves, Harry attends the required monthly training sessions and plans to take a few weeks off from DTI each year to attend annual training. He’s grateful for the flexibility that DTI provides and encourages other veterans to seriously consider DTI as a viable career option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Truck driving is a good experience. In the military you do a lot of traveling, so you can do that here too. Overall as far as setting yourself up in life moneywise, this is a great opportunity. Go Dot!”</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people believe that you need to be 21 in order to become a truck driver. Not true! By law, anyone over the age of 18 can enroll in a trucking school, earn their Class A CDL, and start driving professionally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why do so many trucking companies turn away applicants–even licensed applicants–who are under the age of 21? Simply put, drivers under the age of 21 are not allowed to cross state lines in a commercial vehicle. And since the vast majority of trucking companies require interstate routes, it’s just easier to only consider applicants at least 21 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Dot Transportation, however, many of our distribution centers and terminal locations DO offer intrastate routes for drivers under the age of 21. Intrastate driving can be an excellent way for an 18, 19, or 20-year old driver to get an early start on their driving careers without ever having to stray too far from home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about intrastate driving, we sat down with Mauro Pineda, a Mt. Sterling driver who got his start with Dot Transportation at just 19 years old in 2019.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">When did you become interested in becoming a truck driver?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since I was a little kid, trucks were always interesting. I liked that drivers could travel across the country and get paid for doing it. I liked the work by myself aspect.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Was trucking presented as a viable career option when you were growing up?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high school I never heard about driving as a “right out of high school” option. People either went to college or joined the military. Everyone said to wait until you’re 21. I think some people might consider truck driving right out of high school, but they don’t know that you can drive under the age of 21.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">How did you first become aware of Dot Transportation and Dot Foods?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started working for the warehouse right out of high school in 2018. My brother-in-law worked there and helped me get on. I had always planned to work in the warehouse until I turned 21 and was old enough to drive a truck with DTI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then one day I saw a flyer that said DTI was hiring an intrastate driver and you only had to be 18. They only required six months of full-time experience with Dot, so once that was up I went through all of the interviews and they let me know I was hired and helped me enroll in driving school.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What was the training like?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enrolled at a local trucking school and was there for about a month while working in the warehouse on the weekends. Once I was done with CDL school, I went out on the road with a trainer. After about 7 weeks of on-the-road and in-classroom learning, I was done. They saw I was progressing pretty quickly.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTI training is honestly the best compared to other companies. Some companies want to train you for two weeks and give you the keys. My trainer made sure I was good to go. He gave me the phone numbers for a lot of drivers and driver trainers if I ever needed anything. Training is a little longer with DTI than with other companies, but I think that’s needed.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Did you see a nice pay increase when you made the switch from warehouse to driver?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely! I was making about 50 percent more as a driver. I asked my parents what I should do with the money I was making, and they said to buy a house. So I actually bought my first house at age 21.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What advice would you give to teens looking to get into trucking?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely look into it at an early age. At a lot of our locations DTI will pay you to go to school and pay for your training program, so once you’re done with classes, you’re completely debt free and can start making money right off the bat. You’ll be on your own, independent, no student loans. You don’t have to go through that. This is a great trade to have, it’s just not put out there enough.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What about when you turned 21? Did you want to stay on intrastate only? Or did you have the option?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They give you the option of staying local, but you have to do one overnight. So I could’ve still been home four nights a week. But I chose to start doing a traditional interstate schedule. And they ease you into it. They don’t just send you across the country the day you turn 21. I’m not home every night anymore, but I am making about 20-30 percent more that I did as an intrastate driver.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_8 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">
				
				
				
				
				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Driving in Chicago, huh? Was that difficult as a new driver?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was absolutely intimidating. Especially when you’re new. You just have to try and stay calm. I felt like I was pretty well trained. I was ready. I was just nervous. Keep in mind, I was only 19 and didn’t really know anyone. Everyone I interacted with was older and that can be intimidating too. Just something to get used to.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_9 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">
				
				
				
				
				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Since you couldn’t leave Illinois during those first couple years, did you get more home time as a result?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I was home 99 percent of nights. Some nights I had to sleep in the truck, but I was almost always home. I just drove from Mt. Sterling to Belleville to University Park. A lot of back and forth between Belleville and Chicago.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_10 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">
				
				
				
				
				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Was it easy to adjust to life on the road?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing that took some adjusting was the hours. With driving you can kind of have set hours, but there are a lot of factors that can change your timing: traffic, delay issues, etc. So that all took some adjusting. But DTI was very honest with me with scheduling. They explained that you might be working long hours or waking up early. It’s not impossible though. Anyone can do it as long as they’re willing to put in the work.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole Lane always envisioned himself cruising up and down the West Coast from behind the wheel of a patrol car, but never an 80,000 pound 18-wheeler. But after a year of police academy training followed by countless tests, evaluations, and training sessions, he found himself lost and alone. The law enforcement route was not everything he thought it would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was very stressful. I’d be in the middle of the country going to try to help somebody. Not know how to get there. Not know how to leave. Basically just not know anything,” he said. “That causes a lot of stress in your life and really makes you wonder if that’s really what you want to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He needed a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fiancee’s father, a owner-operator truck driver, suggested Cole go after his CDL and drive a truck for a living. Cole didn’t shut out the idea completely, but he had his doubts.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It sounded like the craziest idea. I don’t know how to drive a truck. They’re huge! It seems way too difficult.”</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_9  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after months of coaxing, Cole decided to go for it. He enrolled in a driving school, earned a CDL, and landed a job as a rookie with DTI. Admittedly, he applied to a number of trucking companies, and is thankful for DTI’s ongoing willingness to train inexperienced drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They liked my personality and my background, and maybe I didn’t have any experience in trucking, but I had life experience and I was responsible,” he said. He commends the training DTI provided and says it provided just enough direction but still the freedom to make your own mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cole_blog_2.jpg" width="510" height="287" alt="Cole sitting in truck" style="padding-bottom:20px;" class="wp-image-35422 alignright size-full" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cole_blog_2.jpg 510w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cole_blog_2-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" />As he set out for his first solo drive, Cole wondered if his family would be okay with him on the road for close to a week at time. He wondered if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be okay being away from them for so long. But as he became more and more comfortable with the requirements of the job, he’s found opportunities to connect with family and friends more and more regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know my grandmother is tired of hearing from me,” he said. “I call her every day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a while to get used to life on the road, but now that he’s become more at ease with the commitments and the lifestyle, he is content with the career path he’s chosen. He enjoys spending time absorbing information from audiobooks and podcasts while he makes his runs. All in all, he is thankful for the compassion shown by his new DTI teammates as well as the stability the company provides its drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the biggest things the sheriff’s department was lacking was stability in life. One of the most difficult things was not knowing if you’d make it home. With DTI you definitely know you’re gonna be safe and you’re going to make it home.”</span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she neared her 40th birthday, Misty Robles, a single mother who had spent much of her twenties and thirties working two jobs, sought to give her professional life a restart. Spending days working in public education and evenings working in retail was exhausting and was not going to be financially sustainable in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I needed to do something different. And I needed to do something quickly,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was first introduced to the idea of trucking school by a friend in the trucking industry, but it wasn’t quite what she had in mind at the time.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_1">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why I Drive for Dot Transportation - Misty" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWPJely77ag?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_12  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a truck driver was never on my radar,” she said. “I like to stay in my little box and it takes a lot to get me out of that.”</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_13  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after about a year of on and off coaxing, Misty figured she’d give it a shot. She liked that trucking school only lasted a few weeks, and by waiting until January, she was able to take advantage of a New Year promotion and save some more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other company recruiters promised she’d be on the road and on her own in a week or two, DTI’s promise of thorough, safety-minded, one-on-one training was far more appealing by comparison. She also liked the weekly home time offered by DTI; a perk uncommon in this industry. In the end, DTI was the only place to which she decided to apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/misty_working.jpg" width="510" height="287" alt="Misty working on truck" class="wp-image-35394 alignright size-full" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/misty_working.jpg 510w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/misty_working-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" />Like any new driver, Misty had her apprehensions about life on the road. But her biggest concern had nothing to do about the hours or the work load. Her biggest concern was that the truck would just be too big for her five foot frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest thing for me was just the sheer size of the truck and trailer, but now that I’m used to it, I’m probably more comfortable in the truck than in my tiny car,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new drivers especially, Misty stresses that the learning curve might be a little more gradual in trucking than it is in other jobs. She reiterates what another driver told her when she was feeling like she just wasn’t getting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She told me to give it a year to get used to everything. I kept that in the back of my head. Most jobs, they expect you to know everything in 60 or 90 days without questions. But with trucking there are just so many things you have to get used to. It just takes time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misty runs a traditional schedule, leaving Tuesdays and returning the following weekend, and makes close to three times what she did working two jobs before. She has been with DTI for _____ years and recently tallied her 500,000th safe mile behind the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a hard job,” she says. “&#8230;but it’s worth it.”</span></p></div>

He sought a career with more freedom, more opportunity, and most importantly, more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course early 2020 was far from the most opportune time for job seekers like Derek as the unemployment rate climbed and businesses started facing the reality of the earliest days of the pandemic. Derek realized finding the perfect job–and one with stability, no less–was going to be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itching to take his mind off of pandemic stresses for a few hours, Derek and his mother drove to a state park for a socially-distant day of fun. He couldn’t help but notice that the notoriously congested highways of Southern California were eerily empty with one notable exception: tractor trailers.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, Derek considered that perhaps commercial truck driving could be his ticket out of the retail world and into something with a better future and better pay. He enrolled in a local trucking school, but as the start date neared, Derek started having doubts.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_17  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was scared, because as a queer person, you’re like ‘can even be in this field?’ Am I even capable of doing this? I was so worried about being different,” he said. “But truck driving showed me that I’m capable of a lot more than I thought I was.”</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_18  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/D_post_image_1.jpg" width="464" height="261" alt="D Driver" class="wp-image-35345 alignright size-full" />After getting his feet wet with another transportation company, Derek joined Dot Transportation in early 2022 after combing through positive reviews on trucker-specific Reddit threads. He couldn’t believe that drivers were guaranteed weekly home time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was like, there’s no way they’re letting people go home after four days when I’m on the road for months with just a few days off,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major perk? The money. His first paycheck came out to roughly four times what he had been making with his previous employer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was no joke,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new driver, Derek struggled with the over-the-road isolation that comes with being a solo driver. But he says that the apprehension has subsided over time and the environment actually helps him stay focused and grounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used to think I would hate open fields and the countryside, but I find those areas the most peaceful. Through driving, I’ve gained more patience than I’ve ever had.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At just 22 years old, Derek is one of Dot Transportation’s youngest professional drivers, but he’s taking the wheel with the confidence of his far more experienced peers. He runs a traditional schedule and opts to handle his own freight in an effort to stay in shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/D_post_image_3.jpg" width="228" height="297" alt="D DTI Driver" class="wp-image-35346 alignleft size-full" />An accomplished and self-taught guitarist, Derek spends his free time connecting with fellow musicians and producers through a recording studio he and his friends operate out of Southern California. On especially long trips, Derek makes sure to bring along a guitar to squeeze in some practice time in between stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek resides near Dot Foods California in Modesto with his fiancee. He’s thankful for the opportunities provided by DTI and encourages anyone looking for a new adventure, regardless of age or experience, to consider truck driving.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re really going to get to know yourself as a truck driver,” he said. “At my other company, I was just another driver. But at DTI, you actually know who you’re driving next to and who is helping you break down freight. That’s what I enjoy the most.”</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving a truck professionally requires dependability, adaptability, and discipline–none of which were foreign to LaShelle Smith when she embarked on a new career as a truck driver. As an entrepreneur and proud veteran of the United States Marine Corps, she’d faced her fair share of obstacles before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high school, she attended a job fair with the intention of meeting with an Army recruiter. As fate would have it, however, the recruiter never showed up and LaShelle happily struck up a conversation with a Marines recruiter instead. The recruiter explained that the Marines were the smallest branch of the military, but the “baddest” of them all. This resonated with LaShelle who is the self-proclaimed “smallest and baddest person around”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Marine, LaShelle served from the age of 18 until 22 as a Hawk Missile Operator and was part of only the third group of women admitted into combat roles. After discharge, she attended Northern Michigan University to study acting and eventually made her way to Chicago where she attended culinary school in hopes of one day owning and operating her own restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her 20s, LaShelle made a living working in restaurants without the big break she’d been hoping for. She even found herself homeless for awhile before working her way out and finding a new start in Arizona. Here, she opened her own taco truck, aptly and affectionately named “The Taco Shelle”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after roughly two decades in the food industry, LaShelle felt it was time for a change and sought the suggestion of a career aptitude survey that recommended law enforcement, military service, or truck driving. Of those three, truck driving seemed to be the most alluring prospect. She enrolled in a local truck driving school, earned her Class A CDL and found work with a local trucking company covering the westernmost 11 states. Though she enjoyed the freedom and adventure of truck driving, the long hours were not conducive to her growing family and she sought a different driving opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some thorough Googling of trucking companies that make home time a priority, she came across Dot Transportation. She joined the DTI ranks in 2021 and hasn’t looked back. She opted for a no-touch position and runs the always popular “4&#215;4” schedule–four days on the road, four days at home–which allows for a predictable schedule and plenty of time with family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April of this year, LaShelle made her small screen debut alongside fellow veteran driver Jim Mathews on Lifetime’s “Military Makeover: Operation Career”; a series that spotlights military veterans and the military-friendly companies by which they’re employed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based out of Dot Transportation’s Dyersburg distribution center, LaShelle recently wrapped her first year as a DTI driver. LaShelle currently resides in Tennessee with her wife of five years, Alicia, their five children ranging in age from 20 years old to six months, and their two dogs and one cat.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Alejandro Alvarez immigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2015, he didn’t know what the future had in store. He just knew that the possibilities in California would be much more lucrative and the sooner he could find a job and lay the groundwork on a new life, the sooner his wife and two teenage children would be able to relocate from Mexico to join him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With hardly any money to his name, Alejandro lived many of those early days on nothing more than a daily cup of coffee and a microwavable soup cup. In desperate need of something that would pay enough to support his family, he began researching salary ranges for jobs that did not require a college degree. Admittedly, he was shocked when he came across the earning potential for truck drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Mexico, Alejandro worked as a substance abuse counselor at a facility he also owned and operated, and driving professionally would be a new challenge for which he had no prior experience. Not letting this stop him, Alejandro enrolled in truck driving school where he was first introduced to Dot Transportation by a visiting recruiter. Impressed by the company culture and intrigued by the financial possibilities, the former counselor and entrepreneur applied to be a DTI driver.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_23  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had never been in a truck before, but DTI makes it easy for students,” he said. “Some people are afraid of big trucks, but DTI teaches you everything and won’t send you out until you are safe.”</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_3">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why I Drive for Dot Transportation | Alejandro and David" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbFN5Vkv3sU?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_24  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, more than a year and a half after arriving in America, Alejandro’s family was able to finally and permanently join him in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Alejandro has racked up nearly one million safe miles as a team driver with DTI. And many of those later miles came alongside the best partner he could’ve asked for: his son, David.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David joined the Dot warehouse team in 2016 and made the switch to driver in 2018. Together, father and son keep their truck rolling close to 24 hours a day for five days a week with the elder Alvarez taking the wheel from 4:00 am to 4:00 pm and David picking up the night shift.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_25  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ateam_2_510x287.jpg" width="510" height="287" alt="A-Team" class="wp-image-35284 alignright size-full" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ateam_2_510x287.jpg 510w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ateam_2_510x287-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" />“In the truck, we’re not father and son. We’re teammates. We give each other space. When one is driving, the other is sleeping or doing their own thing,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while that’s true, they certainly make time to bond and enjoy one another’s company in ways that many fathers and sons cannot. Driving together has allowed Alejandro and David to see corners of the world they never would have otherwise. For instance, on a recent trip to New York, the team parked the truck, hopped in an Uber, and enjoyed a much-deserved lunch break at Niagara Falls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people pay top money to go through a site like that, and we paid $15 for an Uber and we went together and had lunch,” Alejandro said. “That’s one of the great things about driving across the country if you’re willing to appreciate certain moments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they’re not rolling on 18 wheels, both Alejandro and David enjoy spending time on just two; both are accomplished dirt bike enthusiasts who love finding new spots in the desert to test the limits of their bikes. David knows this expensive hobby would not be feasible without the hard work he commits to his day job and the support DTI has shown him and his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driving is a big sacrifice, but it’s worth it in the end,” David said. “It changed my life in many ways. I can do stuff that I couldn’t do before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those interested in team driving–especially those looking to team drive with a son or daughter–Alejandro offers the following words of wisdom:</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nationally televised TV series spotlighting hardworking veterans and the companies for which they work will feature Dot Transportation in one of its episodes this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by Montel Williams, “Military Makeover: Operation Career” airs on the Lifetime Network and highlights American businesses like DTI that actively recruit and hire those who’ve served in the Armed Forces. Each episode features inspirational, biographical stories told by veterans who’ve found professional success in post-military careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upcoming DTI-specific episode will spotlight Dot drivers <a href="https://drivefordti.com/military-makeover/">Jim Mathews and LaShelle Smith</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim served in the Army for 4.5 years and completed a tour in Iraq. He joined DTI in 2017 and recently made the switch to driver trainer out of our Strafford, Missouri terminal location. LaShelle enlisted in the Marines at the age of 17 and served as a hawk missile operator for four years. She joined DTI as a driver out of our Dyersburg, Tennessee location in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Jim and LaShelle, DTI’s fleet of drivers includes more than 200 who have served in the Armed Forces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crews from Military Makeover made their way to DTI’s Mt. Sterling headquarters in March for the shoot which also included an exclusive interview with Dot Foods CEO (and former President of DTI) Joe Tracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DTI episode of “Military Makeover: Operation Career” debuts on the Lifetime network at 7:30 am (ET/PT) on April 29 with an encore presentation on May 5 at the same time. After its initial airing, the episode will be made available for free streaming on militarymakeover.tv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by founder Robert Tracy (a WWII veteran himself), DTI aims to provide <a href="https://drivefordti.com/about-dti/partners-military/">veterans</a> with every opportunity for professional success and growth in their civilian careers. We offer a Veteran Employee Resource Group and are proud partners of the Army PaYS Program and Illinois Hires Heroes Consortium. In a recent survey, 96% of veteran drivers said they would recommend DTI to fellow veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on the upcoming “Military Makeover: Operation Career” episode, or to learn more about DTI’s involvement with veteran outreach and recruiting, visit <a href="https://drivefordti.com/military-makeover/">DriveForDTI.com/military-makeover</a>.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ground-breaking is scheduled for late summer with an estimated completion date slated for fall of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 177,000 square foot distribution center will eventually bring upwards of 250 jobs to the community with driver hiring as the initial focus. While the facility is under construction, we’ll establish a <a href="https://drivefordti.com/terminals/">terminal location</a> in the community. Driver jobs have already been posted and office positions are expected to be posted in 2023. Check our <a href="https://dotfoodscareers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">careers page</a> for the latest on both driver and non-driver positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a population of roughly 11,000, Manchester is approximately the midway point between Nashville and Chattanooga. Manchester is also the famed home of the iconic Bonnaroo Music Festival which attracts the biggest names in music as well as 80,000 to 100,000 eager fans every summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester will be the second Tennessee distribution center after Dyersburg which opened in 2015. Tennessee is also home to terminal locations in Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on the new Manchester distribution center, </span><a href="https://www.dotfoods.com/newsroom/dot-foods-news/dot-foods-to-build-13th-u.s.-distribution-center-in-manchester-tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CLICK HERE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Verde Nice to Meet You” green-toned nails of Dot Transportation Assistant Transportation Manager Sheila Moran have nothing to do with St. Patrick’s Day. Rather, her festive seasonal manicure is a subtle reminder that March is National Kidney Month and the perfect time to remind others about the steps they can take to help save lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheila and Mike–a close friend of more than 40 years–are both living proof of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/167598033_10159564183127806_49633358174850381_n.jpeg-400x300.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Sheila M" class="wp-image-34841 alignleft size-medium" />In 2017, Mike and his wife, Teresa, came to Sheila and her husband, Bob, with shocking and potentially life-threatening news. Mike had end-stage renal disease and would require a kidney transplant. Mike’s best hope would be to find a willing and qualified kidney donor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheila and Bob both stepped up to help their friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to his history of kidney stones, Bob was ineligible to become a donor. Sheila, however, was able to move forward in the multi-step process that was not without its own obstacles. An unforeseen medical issue had Sheila in the hospital for several days and ultimately delayed the process by about six months. And in late 2018, the families made the difficult decision to switch hospitals and find a new care team with Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. By the time the families were able to officially secure a transplant date, nearly a year and a half had passed since Sheila first decided to become a donor. According to Sheila, this duration is on the longer end of the spectrum with most timelines stretching between six months to a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May of that year, the families had officially completed the pre-donor journey and were finally able to get a transplant date on the books: August 20, 2019 (two years after Mike’s initial 2017 diagnosis).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/167805778_10159564183092806_3344901462007681576_n.jpeg-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" alt="Sheila M" class="wp-image-34842 alignright size-medium" srcset="https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/167805778_10159564183092806_3344901462007681576_n.jpeg-225x300.jpg 225w, https://drivefordti.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/167805778_10159564183092806_3344901462007681576_n.jpeg.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />When the big day arrived, the extended families of both Sheila and Mike were on hand at 4:00 am to extend their support and positivity in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all put our hands in and did a ‘let’s go’ cheer before we headed off into surgery,” Sheila said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgery went as planned and without issue. Sheila says that typically doctors will transplant a left kidney, but in this case opted to transplant her right kidney which had a large cyst that was removed prior to Mike’s receiving the kidney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I joke with him that he got the defective one,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately the “defective” one was not so at all. The kidney worked right away and before too long, both Mike and Sheila were on the road to recovery. Sheila notes that neither the procedure nor the recovery time were too severe for either herself or Mike. She was back home to Jacksonville after two nights in the hospital and Mike was headed back home after just four days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly, knee replacement surgery was harder than donating a kidney,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike and Sheila are both doing great to this day and their families are closer than ever before. In 2020, to commemorate their first “kidney-versary” both families took a celebratory trip to Florida for a relaxing and commemorative vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwards of 5,000 people lose their lives every year due to kidney conditions and another 5,000 are taken off of the donor recipient list annually due to declining health. As viable donors can live completely normal lives on a single kidney, she encourages those who are able to “share their spare”. Sheila also recommends checking with your insurance provider and company’s HR departments to find out exactly what costs are covered for prospective donors as well as how medical leave requests will be handled. She’s thankful that Dot Foods and the insurance they provide were 100% on board.</span></p>

Everyone at Dot was very supportive throughout the entire process,” she said.</span></p>
